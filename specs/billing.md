# Subscription & Billing Engine

## Overview

The Subscription & Billing engine provides a flexible system for monetizing the application. It supports multiple subscription plans, varying payment schedules, and abstract payment gateways.

## Key Components

### 1. Plans

- **Class**: `Plan` (`classes/Plan.php`)
- **Definition**: Represents a subscription tier (e.g., "Basic", "Pro").
- **Attributes**:
  - `slug`: Unique identifier.
  - `name`: Display name.
  - `capabilities`: Plan settings the application reads to adjust behavior, e.g. a boolean (`individual: true` limits the account to one member) or a numeric limit (`howto-limit: 10`). Feature flags granted by a plan are configured separately (see [features.md](features.md)).
  - `downgrade_to_slug`: Fallback plan upon cancellation.
  - `grace_period`: Days to wait for payment before downgrading.
- **Hooks**: `account_activate_hook` and `account_deactivate_hook` for custom logic during plan changes.

### 2. Payment Schedules

- **Class**: `PaymentSchedule` (`classes/PaymentSchedule.php`)
- **Definition**: Defines how often and how much a user is charged for a plan.
- **Attributes**:
  - `charge_amount`: Cost per period.
  - `charge_period`: Frequency of billing (in days).
  - `is_default`: Default schedule for a plan.

### 3. Payment Engines

- **Class**: `PaymentEngine` (`classes/PaymentEngine.php`)
- **Role**: Abstract interface for payment providers.
- **Implementations**:
  - **Stripe**: Credit card processing.
  - **External**: Manual or off-platform payments.
- **Functionality**: Handles charge requests, recurrent billing setup, and webhook processing.

### 4. Account Billing State

- **Management**: Handled within the `Account` class.
- **States**:
  - Active plan.
  - Next plan (scheduled change).
  - Outstanding balance.
- **Lifecycle**:
  - **Upgrades/Downgrades**: Handled with proration logic.
  - **Cancellation**: Reverts to the "downgrade" plan (usually Free) after the current period or grace period.

## Configuration

- **Plan Definition**: Plans and schedules are defined in `users_config.php` passed to `Plan::init()`.
- **Gateways**: Credentials for providers like Stripe are configured in `UserConfig`.

## User Interface

- **Plans Page** (`plans.php`): Displays available plans and allows users to subscribe or switch.
- **Billing History**: Users can view past transactions and receipts (managed by `Account` and `TransactionLogger`).
