# System Architecture

## Overview

StartupAPI is built as a distributed system using Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects. It follows a multi-tenant architecture where users and accounts are managed as independent, stateful entities.

## Data Relationships

The following diagram illustrates how different Durable Objects interact within the system:

    UserDO {
        string id PK
        table profile "key-value"
        table sessions "active logins"
        table memberships "account links"
        table user_credentials "provider + subject_id mapping"
    }

    AccountDO {
        string id PK
        table account_info "metadata"
        table members "user links"
        table billing "plan & status"
    }

    SystemDO {
        table users "search index"
        table accounts "search index"
    }

    CredentialDO {
        string id PK "provider"
        table credentials "subject_id -> user_id mapping"
    }
```

## Core Components

### 1. Durable Objects

- **UserDO**: Represents a unique user. Stores profile information, active sessions, account memberships, and a local mapping of linked OAuth credentials.
- **AccountDO**: Represents a tenant (organization or team). Manages account-level metadata, member lists (User IDs and roles), and billing/subscription state.
- **CredentialDO**: Stores all OAuth credentials for a specific provider (e.g., one instance for "google", another for "twitch"). It provides fast lookup of internal User IDs based on OAuth Subject IDs during login.
- **SystemDO**: Acts as a global directory and search index. It maintains a list of all users and accounts to support administrative search and listing features. Mapping between users and credentials is now decentralized.

### 2. Authentication Flow

Authentication is handled via OAuth2 (Google, Twitch). When a user logs in:

1. The `handleAuth` function intercepts the OAuth callback.
2. It identifies or creates the corresponding `UserDO`.
3. It creates a session and returns a signed, encrypted cookie to the browser.
4. Subsequent requests use this session cookie to identify the user and their current account.

### 3. Account & Membership Management

Users can be members of multiple accounts.

- `UserDO` maintains a `memberships` table indicating which accounts the user belongs to and which one is currently active.
- `AccountDO` maintains a `members` table listing all users who have access to that account.
- Changes are synchronized between both objects to ensure consistency.

## Frontend & Integration

- **Power Strip**: A custom element (`<power-strip>`) injected into proxied HTML pages. It provides a consistent UI for login, account switching, and profile management. Authors can place their own `<power-strip>` element to control its placement/styling; in that case the worker injects only `power-strip.js` and leaves the element alone (auto-filling `providers` if omitted, honoring `hidden` for a script-only opt-out). `variant="compact"` renders a single account control for a host's own header instead (a "Log in" pill, or an avatar opening an account menu); the worker writes `auth-state` onto the element from the session (and marks such pages `Cache-Control: private`), and the component remembers the last profile in `localStorage`, so the control paints in its final shape before `/api/me` answers.
- **API Proxy**: The worker acts as a proxy, intercepting `/users/` paths for system features while forwarding other requests to the configured `ORIGIN_URL`.
